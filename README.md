#Overview
This project leverages Ethereum blockchain technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof land registry system. By integrating blockchain's decentralized ledger with GIS mapping, we aim to enhance the accuracy, accessibility, and reliability of land ownership records.

#Features:
-Blockchain Integration: Utilize Ethereum blockchain for immutable and transparent record-keeping of land transactions.
-GIS Mapping: Integrate GIS for precise mapping and visualization of land parcels.
-Smart Contracts: Implement smart contracts to automate and secure land transactions and ownership transfers.
-Decentralized Access: Ensure decentralized access to land registry data, reducing the risk of data manipulation and unauthorized changes.
-Security and Transparency: Enhance the security and transparency of land ownership records, reducing fraud and disputes. Land-registry-with-Ethereum
